# Project 8 - Unsupervised machine learning - 

*Ferdi,Nathan*
*[DA, Paris & 06/22]*

## Description 

Continuing on the subject of machine learning, we started looking in the subject of unsupervised learning this week. The task of this project was to process uber ride requst from the New York City, US and define optimal clusters the city could be devided into. The use of this being that uber drivers could then be assigned to a certain
cluster and could wait at the optimal position for hsi nex uber request (the clusters center).

We started by cleaning the data and preparing it for apllying the unsupervised learning models. We tried multiple different models such as KMEANS, DBSCAN, etc. played with the optimal parameters and number of clusters. The results of our clusters where then visualized using the folium libary on jupyter notebook. 

## Plan
- create Jira plan structure
- import data
- cleand and prepare data
- try various unsupervised learning models and choose the best fit model
- visualize results with folium

## Deliverables
- raw data
- cleaning code
- model apllication code
- cleaned data
- folium code
